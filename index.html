<p>I originally wanted to go to Uni to become an English Major, but I really wanted to learn how to program and code.
    Web development is a class I've always wanted to take. </p>

&lt;pre&gt;However I am enjoying my learning in HTML and find that once everything works, <hr/> it is very satisfactory. &lt;/pre&gt;
